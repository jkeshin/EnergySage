# Building a REST API

For this technical interview, you will build a server application that has a data model and a REST API. You can use (and are encouraged to use) a common backend framework or frameworks to make this easier. You are not necessarily expected to finish this in the time given.

Some possibilities for backend frameworks include:

- Python: Django, Flask, FastAPI
- Node: Express
- Ruby on Rails
- Java: Spring

If your preferred tech stack isnâ€™t one of these, please just ask us about it.

## API Specification

The API specification is being shared using the [Open API Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification). There are a couple of ways to view this through the browsable [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) that will allow you to see samples and make actual requests.

## Viewing the API spec

Included are instructions on how to serve the `index.html` file using node or python, but any webserver could be used to serve the `index.html` file an access the browsable API documentation. Run one of the following commands in the same directory as `index.html` and `customers.yaml`.

### Node

To view the spec in a node environment, run:

```bash
npx browser-sync -w --port 8100
```

### Python

To view the spec using python, run:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8100
```
